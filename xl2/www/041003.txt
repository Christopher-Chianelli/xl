<!--How not to do free software-->

Open-sourcing software is hard. It's already quite difficult for an
individual. The XL project is a good example: to this day, it remains
largely a one person project, which is really sad, if you ask me.

It's even more difficult for corporations to get it right. Here's my
short list of the "Don't" regarding open-source or free software.

<OL>

<LI><B>Don't</B> try to make money in the courts or expect open-source
  contributors to be defenseless individuals. Even if you have
  previously been successful in the court against Microsoft, one of
  the most law-resilient corporations in the world. That was SCO's
  idea, and it backfired. OK, that one was easy and obvious...

<LI><B>Don't</B> try to repair a failing or declining business model
  by open-sourcing your software. If it wasn't successful when the
  the company got captive revenue from it, why should it work when
  customers can get it for free? I wonder if there is more than this
  bad idea behind Sun open-sourcing Solaris.

<LI><B>Don't</B> open-source solely to gain market share. Market share
  depends a lot on the quality / price ratio, but setting the price
  to zero is not enough, because there are many other costs
  associated with any software. That's Microsoft's old and tired TCO
  argument, but there is some truth to it.

<LI><B>Don't</B> expect others to fix your bugs for you. Successful
  open-source software is software that actually works and is
  useful. Unfortunately, here, the counter example is this project,
  XL. It has not reached the "works and is useful" milestone. That's
  why at this point it's still one person's responsibility to make it
  work, alone or with some help.

<LI><B>Don't</B> open-source a sub-par product and expect its failings
  to be compensated by its open-sourceness. People generally use
  product for a specific reasons, and that is true with open-source
  products too. Linus Torvalds uses the non-open-source BitKeeper for
  that reason: he has a job to do, and BitKeeper helps him do it
  better. I'm not convinced by Richard Stallman's arguments in that
  particular case.

<LI><B>Don't</B> tell developers: "Why don't you work for free?"
  Individuals need food, shelter, safety. Even Richard Stallman asked
  for donations when he started GNU. Lack of funding is definitely a
  primary reason XL moves forward so slowly. I need to keep a job, and
  I try to do it right.

<LI><B>Don't</B> simply try to gain coolness points. I first thought
  that Apple was releasing Darwin as open-source for that reason, but
  I believe they have demonstrated since then that they are truly
  commited to open-source. I believe we can thank
  <A href="http://www.wsanchez.net">Wilfredo Sanchez</A> for that.

<LI><B>Don't</B> open-source to get free help. Contributors expect
  something in return: glory, fame, fun, money. In my experience, it
  is harder to get suport for an open-source project than for a
  commercial project. Contributors come and go, they have no ties to
  the project (in particular, no clear financial benefits).
