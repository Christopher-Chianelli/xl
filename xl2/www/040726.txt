<!--Is Linux still Free?-->

Today I had to look for a Linux distribution...Well, it seems pretty
difficult to find a free Linux version these days. I am a bit worried
about that, because it means that GNU ideal of free software (as in
"free speech") doesn't prevent successful free software from becoming
inaccessible to the masses because it is no longer free (as in "free
beer").

I renamed {tt "quote"} to {tt "parse_tree"}, which probably makes it
easier to read. At least, that's my hope.

Something I forgot to mention yesterday: my brother told me that
the GPL reportedly has an issue with French/European law, because of
the "hand washing" clause (limiting liability of developers beyond
what is accepted here). I am not convinced yet that this is the case at
this point, since section 11 of the GPL specifically states: "to the
extent permitted by law". Anyways, it looks like Inria has developed a
license that is compatible both with the GPL and with local laws,
called CeCILL. I might switch to that license if I feel that this is
necessary.
