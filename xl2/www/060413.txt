<!--Iterators, redux-->

Implemented the complete iterator syntax. Note that what I had
yesterday still works, but it's no longer necessary in most cases,
it's just an "intermediate form" for the end-user syntax.

An iterator is now defined with code like the following:

{pre}
iterator IntFor(It : integer; Low, High : integer) written It in Low..High is
    It := Low
    while It <= High loop
        It := It + 1

for I in 1..5 loop
   WriteLn "I=", I
{erp}

It generates the code that I showed yesterday as an intermediate code.
And you know what? I am actually proud of this solution :-) It is not
perfect yet, because you can't declare local variables in
an iterator, since it's actually split into 4 functions. To be fixed.

See {cvs "TESTS/08.Aggregates/for_loops.xl"} for an example of test,
if SourceForge helps me (they seem to have problem with their ViewCVS).

Also, there was a major bug I had overlooked: written forms could not
be used for generic subroutines. It's fixed.
