<!--Nested Modules-->

The implementation of modules now passes a set of basic tests,
including for nested modules. When you seen that I
was <A href="041012.html">already working on that</A> more than one
year ago, you can see that the pace increased dramatically in the past
weeks. We may be getting somewhere very soon now.

I also added the definition of a basic
<A href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xlr/xl2/native/xl_builtins.xs?view=markup">
XL_BUILTINS</A> module implementation. So now we have things like
integer and real types, addition, and so on. The bytecode is not fully
updated yet, but that should help you understand what all I did so far
was about.

On to generics...
