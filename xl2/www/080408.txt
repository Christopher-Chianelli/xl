<!--Function pointers-->

Added support for function pointers in {svnrev 370}. The real problem
was support for overloading, as illustrated in
{svn "TESTS/06.Functions/pointer.xl" "this test"}, reproduced below:

<blockquote>
<pre>procedure Foo (X : integer) is
    WriteLn "Foo ", X

procedure Foo (X : real) is
    WriteLn "Foo (real) ", X

procedure Bar (X : integer) is
    WriteLn "Bar ", X

type proc_ptr is procedure (X : integer)

to Invoke (callback : proc_ptr) is
   callback 3

Invoke Foo
Invoke Bar</pre>
</blockquote>

In that example, the problem is with <tt>Invoke Foo</tt>, which needs
to be able to decide which <tt>Foo</tt> is to be selected
(the first one in that case).
