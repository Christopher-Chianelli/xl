<!--SymADE-->

Those interested in XL might want to take a look at
<a href="http://www.symade.org">SymADE</a>. This is an extensible
compiler for Java. Based on a quick analysis of the code and
documentation, it appears to take a direction similar to my own
<a href="http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/moka.html">Moka</a>,
though I believe SymADE can ultimately be a much more useful tool
for Java developers.

On the downside, I think that extensibility in such a framework is
going to be a lot more complex than it is in something more radical
like XL. As usual, there is a tradeoff between compatibility and
efficiency.
