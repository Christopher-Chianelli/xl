<!--Added pragma support-->

The notation for {concept "pragma" "pragmas"} (between curly braces)
has been added to the compiler. It is processed by semantics (which is
currently activated only if you use the {tt "-sem"} option to the compiler.

Various fixes in the parser to support the use of blocks as prefix,
and low priority {inside "tree" "blocks"}. Pragmas are low-priority blocks.

I had a discussion with my brother, and he noticed that the name {tt "quote"}
is not that good. I need to find something more in line with the
{@cp} ideals :-) What about {tt "build_tree"}?

Following suggestions from the mailing list, I added a link to the
mailing list and a link to build instructions.
