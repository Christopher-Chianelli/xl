<!--Updated Concept Programming Slides-->

Based on feedback from many people (most notably Daveed Vandevoorde and Lionel Schaffhauser), I posted a new <a href="http://xlr.sourceforge.net/Concept%20Programming%20Presentation.pdf">presentation</a> about Concept Programming. This should make the ideas much easier to grasp.

During the discussion, Daveed Vandevoorde pointed me to a very interesting paper about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf">memory transactional models</a>, which he used as an argument in favor of functional programming. Recommended reading, even if I don't think that this is a point for functional programming at all myself.

Lionel Schaffhauser pointed out a number of presentation-related issues, which prompted me to change the order of the slides and add a whole section about the "Maximum" example.

As a reminder, there is also an older presentation <a href="http://xlr.sf.net/cpxl.mov">about XL itself</a>.
