<!--First implementation of destructors-->

An XL destructor is any procedure called {tt "delete"}. I did a basic
implementation today, without much testing yet.

I repaired "Hello world" and a case that was failing with
iterators. Both boiled down to incorrect determination whether we were
evaluating an iterator or an expression.
