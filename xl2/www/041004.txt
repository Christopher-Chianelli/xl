<!--HP fights against blogs-->

Much has been said recently about a blog war between Sun and RedHat
employees. I'm not sure of the value of shouting "my open source is
better than yours" to the world.

But <A href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8446">this</A>
is even more ridiculous. Now, we have HP asking a competitor "could
you please stop saying bad things about our products?". Hey, HP, do
you think that you can change a thing about Sun's opinion of HP
products by doing that? Does anybody at HP think that customers will
think higher of HP-UX because of that action?

And then, if saying that HP-UX is dying is so bad, shouldn't HP also
<A href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8448">write to Bill
  Gates</A>? It seems pretty clear to me that a "Windows and Linux
  only game" implies that HP-UX won't be there in a few years...
