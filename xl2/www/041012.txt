On a request by Gustavo, the web pages now feature "Up",
"Previous" and "Next" links.

According to Lionel, some versions of CygWin have
trouble with environment variables in makefiles. In that case, the
build loops forever with an empty {tt "BUILDENV"}. I suggested a
workaround, but I don't know if it will work.

Sebastien did some work to port the Visual C++ port to the free
version of the Microsoft compiler
({link "http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/"}),
which is not included in the main tree yet.
The build succeeds, but the native compiler fails to compile a simple
Hello World, having trouble reading the default {tt "xl.stylesheet"}.

Meanwhile, I'm still stuck on imports (mostly by lack of time).
