<!--Enumerations-->

With {svnrev 338}, XL now has basic support for
{svn "TESTS/08.Aggregates/enumerations.xl" "enumerations"}.
Not a big deal as far as features are concerned, but it allowed me to
figure out a long-standing bug in the treatment of named types that
had prevented alternate {tt "X.Y"} translations from working right.
