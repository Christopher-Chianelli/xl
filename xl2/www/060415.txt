<!--Generic iterators-->

Of course, generic iterators did not work the first time. Some
tuning required. Now, the following works:

{pre}generic [type item]
iterator Looping (var It : item;
                  Low, High : item) written It in Low..High is
    It := Low
    while It <= High loop
        yield
        It := It + 1

for I in 1..5 loop
    for J in 2..4 loop
        WriteLn "I=", I, " J=", J
{erp}

Hello World is still borked.
