<!--Concept Programming Slides-->

I finally posted
<a href="http://xlr.sourceforge.net/Concept%20Programming%20Presentation.pdf">a
slideset about concept programming</a> that had been rotting on my
hard disk for way too long...

This gave me an opportunity to re-read older articles on
these topics, one I had written for <a href="http://www.ddj.com/java/184404696">Dr
  Dobb's Journal</a>,
and <a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7784/byt1070853295820/1208_heller.html">another one </a>
written by Martin Heller (Mr. Computer Language Person) in Byte.
