<!--Working on code generation for function calls-->

I've got a prototype of {concept "expred" "written"} that seems to
work. For simple cases, that is. Not checked-in yet, see below.

Unfortunately, it made the current limitations in the code generation
for function really really painful. Specifically, at this point, when
you do full semantics / code generation (not the hacked-together
{inside "bootstrap" "C++-emitting mode"}), you cannot have nested
function calls... So I'm trying to fix that and, while I am at it,
implement {example "inout" "input and output parameters"}.

Also, I settled on a syntax for built-in operators (those which are
defined in the {inside "bytecode"}):

{pre}function Add(X, Y : integer) return integer written X+Y is bultin add_int{erp}
