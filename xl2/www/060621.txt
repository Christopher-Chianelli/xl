<!--Switching to Subversion-->

The project has switched to Subversion for revision
control. Subversion is more modern than CVS, and we have been using at
work successfully for quite a while.

To check out the subversion repository, use:

{pre}svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xlr/trunk .
{erp}

One of the benefits of Subversion is that check-ins record all the
items that have been modified. For instance, here is the contents of
yesterday's check-in, {svnrev 270}.
