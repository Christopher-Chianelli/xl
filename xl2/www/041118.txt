<!--Mailing list discussions-->

These days, I am having a hard time finding any moment to work on the
code of XL. I decided it was time to find a way to make it happen
faster. The good news, however, is that the community is building
up. You may want to take a look at the
<A href="There have been a few fai">XL mailing list</A> for some
recent activities.

If you are running Windows, there are currently two possible ports:
Cygwin or Visual C++. Both had been broken over time, and they are
now being repaired. If you had trouble last time you tried XL, you
may want to try again.

The main development platform today remains OSX, and I also test on
Linux at home. You should have little problem with these.
