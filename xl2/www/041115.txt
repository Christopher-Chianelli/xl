<!--iPod-->

I received an iPod Mini offered by IBM for being judge of ports of XL
on LinuxPPC (see the
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/ppc_contest.php">LinuxPPC
contest</A>). It's gold. Definitely not pink. A very nice gesture from
IBM there.

I never considered buying an iPod, since I don't like having buds
in my ears (it always feels painful after a while). So I always listen
to music from my Mac or from the HP DE200C Linux appliance where I
installed MythTV. But now that I have one, I understand what all the
fuss about it is. It is a remarkable piece of engineering and
design. And the sound is surprisingly good. Too bad it still hurts my
ears after a few minutes, I'd probably be using it a lot more
otherwise...
