<!--Restarting XL-->

I've been away from XL for a while, but I think I will finally find
the time to do some work on it. More info on the other stuff that
keeps me busy on my
<a href="http://grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.com">personal blog</a>.

The good news is:
 - I can now compile the compiler faster than ever (thank you MacBook pro)
 - I found a solution for documentation and other stuff (thank you Parallels)

Another serious issue is the amount of spam on the mailing lists. I
will probably simply create a new list and drop the old one.
