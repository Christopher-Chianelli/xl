<!--Pointers-->

The support for generics is now sufficiently robust to allow me to
write modules defining pointer types. See
{svn "TESTS/08.Aggregates/address-of-operator.xl"} for an example of
the use of the functionality defined in {svn "library/xl.pointer.xs"}
and {svn "library/xl.pointer.address.xs"}.

I am still thinking about the various pointer models I'm going to
provide.
