<!--Import takes more time than expected-->

Well, I thought I could do it last Wednesday, and then my wife
reminded me of various things we need to do to host a guest in two
weeks. So I spent the day hacking furniture instead of hacking
software.

There is one little thing I'm trying to evaluate. When you write
{tt "import X.Y.Z"}, I intend to make sure that it first imports
{tt "X"}, then {tt "X.Y"}, and finally {tt "X.Y.Z"}. On the other hand, I'm
tempted to reuse imports, to avoid re-parsing and processing the same
import again and again. This means that if I write {tt "import X.Y"} and
another module imported {tt "X.Y.Z"}, then I'm going to see
{tt "X.Y.Z"} despite the fact that I didn't import it myself. Is that
bad?

Found in a Slashdot signature:
<A HREF="http://www.greenfaces.se/upload/uploads/godvsbush.gif">
God is against Bush</A>. I found some other arguments against Bush
smart, enlightening, frightening. This one I found funny, since it
uses Bush's own "God is with me" arguments against him :-) I just
hope the guy who designed that page doesn't consider it too seriously...
