<!--Discussions-->

I mentioned XL on this
<A href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=124877">
Slashdot discussion</A>, and was told that I was developing a clone
of Python.

There was a suggestion from Gustavo on the
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=mozart-dev-lx-lang">
XL mailing list</A> that I will try to follow: adding Next and
Previous buttons on the web site. I just want to automate it,
otherwise it will never be up to date. Back to Emacs Lisp
(I use <A href="http://billstclair.com/blogmax/">BlogMax</A>).

A lot of things to do during the week-end, so no work done on XL,
unfortunately.
