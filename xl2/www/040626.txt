<!--XL updated on SourceForge-->

For a while, public updates to the XL projects had been suspended, as
I was discussing with my employer the application of their new
"open-source" policy to this particular project. The issue has now
been resolved. The most recent changes to the code have been
committed to the SourceForge CVS tree.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the changes:
<UL>
<LI>There is are now basic semantics for
  {cvs "xl.semantics.declarations.xl" "declaration"},
  {cvs "xl.semantics.functions.xl" "C-style functions"},
  and {cvs "xl.semantics.overload.xl" "C++-style overloading"}.
  It is still primitive. I am currently working mostly on
  improving this basic semantics.
<LI>Added a {cvs "TESTS/alltests" "test directory"} (which is not populated
  yet).
<LI>I started defining a {cvs "xl.bytecode" "bytecode interface"}.
  This is not quite what I want, but it's sufficient for now. It
  currently emits C, though I intend to be able to emit assembly
  language or any textual form ultimately.
</UL>
