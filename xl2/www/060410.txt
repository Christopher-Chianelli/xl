<!--Automatic output parameters-->

Automatic output parameters allow a procedure to declare a variable in
the caller's scope if the name does not exist. This is only a
moderately useful feature by itself, but that seemed like the most
promising option to solve the issue of automatic declaration of 'for'
loop variables, because it's the most general.

It is not complete however: the same technique needs to be extended to
written form if I want to be able to use it in 'for' loops.
