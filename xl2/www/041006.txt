<!--Recruiting-->

Just a little reminder: <B><FONT SIZE=+1>This project is
recruiting</FONT></B>. No pay, hard work, very low probability of
eternal glory, but 
<A href="http://www.marssociety.org">
very low probability of ever being strapped in a
insanely high-velocity projectile either</A>.

I found someone who might be interested a few days ago, and I
hope he will contribute. But anybody with even a mild interest in
meta-programming, or with a mild annoyance with C++, C# or Java, is
very welcome to join.

Historically, recruiting has been difficult, because the best
engineers tend to have their hands full or conflicting commitments. I
once had a contributor who happened to work for... Microsoft. When
asked, Microsoft wouldn't let him work on any open-source
project. What a surprise!

To be fair, even companies 
<A href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1189424,00.asp">
professing an undying love of open-source or free software</A> seem to
grok the benefits much faster than the ideology or the method
(particularly true for Free Software). HP, for instance, requests that
all engineers working on open-source or free software sign a release
granting special rights to HP. This is fair when HP paid the engineers
to do the job. But what if HP had nothing to do with the software in
the first place? What if the software predates employment at HP? More
generally, how do you balance open-source and protection of IP or
shareholder value?

I was away in Belgium for a few days, so no real work done on XL. I'm
hesitating between a quick and dirty hack for imports or a fairly
complete implementation that, obviously, is more tricky to get right.

Regarding <A href="http://emacs-on-aqua.sf.net">another project</A>,
Adrian Robert has just
<A href="http://penguin.med.cornell.edu/stuff/emacs-gnustep.png">
completed an adaptation</A> of my MacOSX port of
Emacs to GNUStep. Congratulations! Folks, fire your browsers! I have
zero time to dedicate to a port to Emacs 21 (all this is currently
based on Emacs 20.7). And Adrian seems to be a bit burnt out to
attack this rather large job right now himself. Another case of free
software needing your help.
