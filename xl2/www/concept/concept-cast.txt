<!--Concept cast-->

A concept cast happens when a particular {@concept} cannot be
{@represented}, and the programmer uses instead a closely related
{@concept} as a workaround.

For instance, {@C} doesn't have a real notion of array. Instead, it
uses pointers. A concept cast like this introduces {@semnoise}.
In that example, the notation {tt "A[B]"} in C is really a shortcut for
{tt "*(A+B)"}. This makes it very easy to access elements outside the
bounds of the array, and overwriting random memory (a frequent source
of bugs in C, known as buffer overrun). Another side effect is that
it is legal in C to write {tt "1[A]"} to access the first element of
the array, or even {tt "-1[A+2]"}. These notations, however, are
somewhat surprising and hard to decode.
