<!--Bandwidth-->

The bandwidth measures how much of the {@pb} is covered by a
particular {@representation} of a {@concept}.

For instance, one can
say that the bandwidth of the {tt "+"} operator in {@C} is larger
than the bandwidth of the {tt "add"} instruction in assembly
language, because the C operator applies to floating-point values as
well. Since {@C++} adds operator overloading, you can use the same
notation for matrices or complex numbers. Consequently, the bandwidth of the
{tt "+"} operator in C++ is larger than in C.
