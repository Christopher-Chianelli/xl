<!--New web site-->

After a long intermission, here is the new XL web site. You may
notice that it has been completely reorganized. The objective is to
make it easier to explore.

At this point, I tried to populate as many of the individual
articles as I could. However, I feel they are all quite terse, and
might deserve examples or other things to make them easier to
understand. This is in plan, but please do not hesitate to send
feedback on pages you find particularly obscure...
