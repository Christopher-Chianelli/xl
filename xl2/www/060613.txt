<!--Optimization in the library-->

Sometimes, the simplest solution is the right one...

The {tt "XL_BUILTINS"} module was made much more lightweight by moving
all sized integer and real operations off to their own modules, called
{tt "XL.SIZED_INTEGERS"} and {tt "XL.SIZED_REALS"}. This significantly
reduces the size of {tt "XL_BUILTINS"}, and in particular reduces the
number of overload candidates you have to lookup for simple things
like {tt "1+2"}. The result is that the time needed to run the test
suite was cut almost in half.
