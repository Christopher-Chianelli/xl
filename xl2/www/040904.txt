<!--Expression Reduction-->

I am currently in the process of implementing
{@concept "expred" "expression reduction"}. Also, I added a {tt "trace"}
statement in the compiler, to automate the generation of traces. The
usage is in the form:

{pre}trace [sometrace] "Hello, X=", X
{erp}

It works like {tt "WriteLn"}, but is conditional on a flag named
{tt "sometrace"}, which you trigger form the command line by
specifying {tt "-tsometrace"}.
