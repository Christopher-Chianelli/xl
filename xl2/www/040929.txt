<!--Day off-->

I took a day off today. The french system doesn't allow me to save
that day for later. So I can spend some time hacking XL. I'm going to
work on the module system today.

And that's a welcome break from HP too. My best friend received his

If you need a truly outstanding software engineering project/program
manager,
<A href="mailto:christophe@dinechin.org">drop me a note</A> and I'll
forward to him.

I also decided that it was time to post my <A href="http://www.dinechin.org/christophe/Resume.html">Resume</A> on-line.

Found an interesting graph by reading Miguel de Icaza's blog:
