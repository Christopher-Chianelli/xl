To build the C++ version of the compiler, type "make" at the top level.

If this is successful, to build the XL version of the compiler, go to the
bootstrap directory and type "make".

If this is successful, in that same bootstrap directory, type "make test".
This will build two compilers in a row and compare their output.

Please understand that this is very raw at that point.
To get a better picture of where I want to go, see the XL compiler on
the Mozart web site (http://mozart-dev.sf.net/xl.html). Note that there
will be minor changes in syntax since then.
