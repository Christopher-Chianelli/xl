To build the C++ version of the compiler, type "make" at the top level.

If this is successful, it should build
1/ A bootstrap compiler written in C++ in the top directory
2/ A bootstrap compiler written in XL in the 'bootstrap' directory
3/ A development compiler written in XL in the 'native' directory

It should also run a fairly small series of tests found under native/TESTS.
You can run these tests manually by going there and typing ./alltests

The 'native' directory is where your own contributions should go.

For documentation on the project, please refer to http://xlr.sf.net


Thank you for helping.
