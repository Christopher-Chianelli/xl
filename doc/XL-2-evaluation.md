[Program evaluation](XL-2-evaluation.md) is entirely defined in terms
of that normal form. For efficiency, actual implementations are
likely to [optimize representations](#compiled-forms-for-code-and-data)
of both code and data, as long as that optimized representation
respect the semantics associated with the normal form.



## Compiled forms for code and data

Code and any data can also have one or several _compiled forms_. The
compiled forms are generally very implementation-dependent, varying
with the machine you run the program on as well as with the compiler
technology being used.
