XL is an extensible programming language. It is designed to accomodate
a variety of programming needs with ease. Being _extensible_ means
that the language is designed to make it very easy for programmers to
adapt the language to suit their needs, for example by adding new
programming constructs. In XL, extending the language is a routine
operation, much like adding a function or creating a class in more
traditional programming languages.

As a consequence of this extensibility, XL is intended to be suitable
for programming tasks ranging from the simplest to the most complex,
from documents and application scripting, as illustrated by
[Tao3D](https://tao3d.sf.net), to compilers, as illustrated by the XL2
[self-compiling compiler](../xl2/native) to distributed programming,
as illustrated by [ELFE](https://github.com/c3d/elfe).
